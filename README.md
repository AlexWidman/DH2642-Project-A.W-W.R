# DH2642-Project-A.W-W.R

## Description

An application for fetching data from a Spotify API, and using this data for a web application where the user can compare songs and artists to one another and save songs to their playlist. There will also be a game of sorts where the user is given two tracks or artists and have to guess which of them is more popular than the other. Our target user is people who love music and listen to it regularly who also wants to be able to look at statistics of their music and favourite artists and compare.

## What we have done so far

So far in the project, the data has been fetched from the API, and the search function used to look up artists or tracks has been implemented. With looking up a track or an artist, the picture associated with them is accompanied with their names in the search results. 

## What we plan to do

We plan to implement a page where the user can see their playlist, as well
